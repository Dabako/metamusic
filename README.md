# MetaMusic

MetaMusic is a standalone application that takes a URL to an Apple Music album
as input and outputs metadata about the album, as well as downloads the album
cover in the best available resolution. For example, running the application
with the following URL:

```
https://music.apple.com/us/album/purple-rain-deluxe-expanded-edition-2015-paisley-park/1229320468
```

will output metadata about the album "Purple Rain (Deluxe Expanded Edition)
[2015 Paisley Park Remaster]" by Prince, as well as download the album cover.

## How to use

To use MetaMusic, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can
check if you have it installed by running the following command in your
terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python 3 installed, please follow the instructions on the
[official Python website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install it.

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this repository and run the
`main.py` script as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b-faller/metamusic.git
cd metamusic
python3 main.py
```

The script will then output the metadata for the specified album, as well as
download the album cover in the highest available resolution.

## Code

The code for MetaMusic is provided in the `main.py` file. The code is mostly
written by a large language model trained by OpenAI, with minor modifications by
a human editor. The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- `requests` for sending HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML
- `Pillow` for handling images

## README written by ChatGPT

This README was also mostly generated by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by
OpenAI and later slightly edited. ChatGPT is a tool that can generate human-like
text based on the input provided to it. In this case, the input was the code for
the MetaMusic application, and ChatGPT was asked to generate a README for the
application.
